This is a simple Flask app that interacts with a MySQL database. The app allows users to submit messages, which are then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Usage

1. Start the containers using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the Flask app in your web browser:

   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend: http://localhost:5000

3. Create the `messages` table in your MySQL database:

   - Use a MySQL client or tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin) to execute the following SQL commands:
   
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE messages (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         message TEXT
     );
     ```

4. Interact with the app:

   - Visit http://localhost to see the frontend. You can submit new messages using the form.
   - Visit http://localhost:5000/insert_sql to insert a message directly into the `messages` table via an SQL query.

## Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the Docker containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the containers are running, or use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```



- If you encounter issues, check Docker logs and error messages for troubleshooting.
